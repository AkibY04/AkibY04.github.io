# **About Me**
I'm a current senior at Stony Brook University with a passion for full-stack development and data analysis. 
I've gotten hands-on experience ranging from API integration and data visualization to enhancing team collaboration through tools / applications.
If I'm not working on something, I'm playing basketball :basketball:, watching movies :tv:, or catching up on sleep :zzz:.
